    Prove Theorem $5.1$: A polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$
    of degree greater than zero is either irreducible
    or the product of irreducibles.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f$ be a polynomial with degree greater than $0$.
    We proceed by induction on the degree of $f$.

    (\textbf{Base Case}) A polynomial of degree one is irreducible.

    (\textbf{Induction Step}) 
    Suppose the theorem holds for all polynomials of degree $m < n$.
    If $f$ of degree $n$ is irreducible, we are done.
    Suppose $f$ is not irreducible; then $f = l \cdot g$ where $l, g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ 
    and $\deg(l), \deg(g) < \deg(f)$.
    By the induction hypothesis, $l$ and $g$ can be expressed as a product of irreducible polynomials.
    Therefore, $f$ can also be expressed as a product of irreducibles.
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 2, breakable]
    Prove Theorem $5.2$: A polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$
    is irreducible if and only if it is prime.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f$ be an arbitrary polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

    ($\rightarrow$) Suppose $f$ is irreducible and $f \mid l g$.
    Furthermore, suppose $f$ does not divide $l$.
    We must show that $f \mid g$.
    Suppose that $d$ is a common divisor of $f$ and $l$.
    Then, because $f$ is irreducible, $d$ must 
        be equal to $f$ or a unit.
    Because $f$ does not divide $l$, it must be that    
        $\gcd(f, l) = 1$.
    So by the GCD identity there exist $x, y \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$
        such that $1 = l x + f y$. 
    Multiplying both sides by $g$ gives
        \[ g = l g x + f g y. \]
    Since $f$ divides both terms on the right-hand side,
        it follows that $f \mid g$, as required.

    ($\leftarrow$) Suppose $f$ is prime.
    Furthermore, suppose $f$ has been factored as $f = l g$.
    Then $f \mid l g$, and so, without loss of generality,
        $f \mid l$.
    Thus, $l = f x$, and so $f = f x g$. 
    Cancelling $f$ gives $1 = x g$, and so both $x$ and $g$
        must be degree $0$ polynomials.
    This shows that the factorization $f = l g$
        is trivial, as required.
\end{proof}

    Prove Corollary $5.3$: If an irreducible polynomial
    in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ divides a product $f_1 f_2 f_3 \ldots f_n$,
    then it divides one of $f_i$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.
    Furthermore, suppose $f \mid f_1 f_2 f_3 \ldots f_n$.
    We proceed by induction on $n$.

    (\textbf{Base Case})  
    If $f \mid f_1 f_2$, then by the definition of being prime, 
    $f \mid f_1$ or $f \mid f_2$.

    (\textbf{Induction Step})  
    Assume the statement holds for $n - 1$; that is, 
    if $f \mid f_1 f_2 \cdots f_{n-1}$, then $f \mid f_i$ for some $i < n$.  
    Now suppose $f \mid f_1 f_2 \cdots f_{n-1} f_n$.  
    Let $c = f_1 f_2 \cdots f_{n-1}$, so $f \mid c f_n$.  
    By the definition of being prime, $f \mid c$ or $f \mid f_n$.  
    By the induction hypothesis, if $f \mid c$, then $f \mid f_i$ for some $i < n$.  
    Thus, in either case, $f$ divides one of the $f_i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 4, breakable]
    Use Gauss's Lemma to determine which of the following 
    are irreducible in $Q[x]$:
    \[4x^3 + x - 2, 3x^3 - 6x^2 + x - 2, x^3 + x^2 + x - 1\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
    If $f(x) = 4x^3 + x - 2$ can be factored then one of 
        the factors is of the form $(ax + b)$
        where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    The only possible factors are 
        $(4x \pm 1)$, $(4x \pm 2)$, $(2x \pm 2)$, $(2x \pm 1)$, $(x \pm 2)$, $(x \pm 1)$.
    This implies roots of $\pm \frac{1}{4}$, $\pm \frac{1}{2}$, $\pm 2$, $\pm 1$.
    By inspection this is not the case.
    Since $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ by Gauss's Lemma $f$ is irreducible in $Q[x]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
    Let $f(x) =  3x^3 - 6x^2 + x - 2$.
    By inspection $x = 2$ is a root thus by the Root Theorem 
        $f$ is not irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
    If $f(x) =  x^3 + x^2 + x - 1$ can be factored then one of 
        the factors is of the form $ax + b$.
    The only possible factor is $(x \pm 1)$.
    By inspection this is not the case.
    Since $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ by Gauss's Lemma $f$ is irreducible in $Q[x]$.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 6, breakable]
    Prove the Rational Root Theorem $5.6$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{theorem}[Ration Root Theorem $5.6$]
    Suppose that $f = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n$
    is a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, and $\frac{p}{q}$ is 
    a rational root; that is, $p$ and $q$ are integers, $q \ne 0$,
    and $f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = 0$. We may as well assume also that 
    $gcd(p, q) = 1$. Then $q$ divides the integer $a_n$, and 
    $p$ divides $a_0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We first show $q \mid a_n$.
    Plugging in $\frac{p}{q}$ shows 
    \[f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = a_0 + a_1 \frac{p}{q} + \cdots + a_n \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^n = 0.\]
    Then multiplying through by $q^n$ shows 
    \[a_0 q^n + a_1 p q^{n - 1} + a_2 p^2 q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_n p^n = 0\]
    Solving for $a_n p^n$ shows 
    \[a_n p^n = - a_0 q^n - a_1 p q^{n - 1} - a_2 p^2 q^{n-2} - \cdots - a_{n - 1} p^{n-1} q\]
    Then factoring out $q$ shows 
    \[a_n p^n = -q(a_0 q^{n-1} + a_1 p q^{n - 2} + \cdots + a_{n - 1} p^{n-2})\]
    Since $\gcd(p, q) = 1$, it follows that $q \not \mid p^n$.
    Thus $q \mid a_n$.
    We now show $p \mid a_0$.
    In the previous part it was shown that 
    \[a_0 q^n + a_1 p q^{n - 1} + a_2 p^2 q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_n p^n = 0\]
    Solving for $a_0 q^n$ shows 
    \[a_0 q^n = -(a_1 p q^{n - 1} + a_2 p^2 q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_n p^n)\]
    We can then factor out $p$ so 
    \[a_0 q^n = -p(a_1 q^{n - 1} + a_2 p q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_n p^{n - 1})\]
    Since $\gcd(p, q) = 1$, it follows that $p \not \mid q^n$.
    Thus $p \mid a_0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 7, breakable]
    Use the Rational Root Theorem $5.6$ to factor 
    \[2x^3 - 17x^2 - 10x + 9\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Solution:}

Using the Root Theorem we find the following possible roots
\[\text{Candidates = } \{\pm \frac{9}{1},\pm \frac{9}{2},\pm \frac{3}{1},\pm \frac{3}{2},\pm \frac{1}{1},\pm \frac{1}{2}\}\]
Inspection shows that $9$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ are roots.
Dividing $2x^3 - 17x^2 - 10x + 9$ by $(x - 9)(x - \frac{1}{2})$ gives us $(2x + 2)$. Thus 
\[2x^3 - 17x^2 - 10x + 9 = (x - 9)(x - \frac{1}{2})(2x + 2)\]

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 9, breakable]
    Use the Rational Root Theorem $5.6$ (applied to $x^3 - 2$)
    to argue that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
    For contradiction, suppose $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a rational root 
        for $x^3 - 2$.
    Since $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is rational it can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$
        where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.
    By the Rational Root Theorem $5.6$
        it follows that $a \mid -2$ and $b \mid 1$.
    There exists $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that 
        $-2 = a k_1$ and $1 = b k_2$.
    Then 
    \[\sqrt[3]{2} = \frac{\frac{-2}{k_1}}{\frac{1}{k_2}} = \frac{-2 k_2}{k_1}\]
    It follows that $2 = \frac{-8 k_2^3}{k_1^3}$. Multiplying by $k_1^3$
    and dividing by $2$ shows that $k_1$ is even.
    Rewriting $k_1 = 2 k_3$ where $k_3 \in \mathbb{Z}$  
        we get 
        \[2 = \frac{-8 k_2^3}{(2k_3)^3} 
            \iff 2 (2 k_3)^3 = -8 k_2^3
            \iff 16 k_3^3 = -8 k_2^3.\]
    Dividing by $8$ shows that $k_2$ is even, contradicting 
        that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
    For contradiction, suppose $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a rational root 
    of $x^3 - 2$. Then we can write $\sqrt[3]{2} = \frac{a}{b}$, 
    where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\gcd(a, b) = 1$.  
    By the Rational Root Theorem $5.6$ any rational root $\frac{a}{b}$ 
        must satisfy $a \mid -2$ and $b \mid 1$.  
    Thus the only possible rational roots are 
    \[
        \pm 1, \quad \pm 2.
    \]  
    Inspection shows that no combination works.
    Thus  $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational.
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 10, breakable]
    Suppose that $\alpha$ is a real number (which might 
    not be rational), and suppose that it is a root of a 
    polynomial $p \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$; that is,
    $p(\alpha) = 0$. Suppose further that $p$ is irreducible
    in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. Prove that $p$ has a minimal degree in the 
    set 
    \[\mathcal{F} = \{f \in \mathbb{Q}[x] : f(\alpha) = 0 \text{ and } f \ne 0\}\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose there exists $g \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$
        such that $\deg(g) < \deg(p)$.
    By the Division Theorem there exists $q, r \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$
        such that $p = g q + r$ and $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$.
    Then 
    \[0 = p(\alpha) = g(\alpha)q(\alpha) + r(\alpha) = 0 + r(\alpha) = r(\alpha),\]
    thus $r(\alpha) = 0$. 

    Either $\deg(r) = 0$ or $\deg(r) > 0$.
    Suppose $\deg(r) = 0$, then since $r(\alpha) = 0$, $r$ is the zero polynomial.
    Since $\deg(p) = \deg(g) + \deg(q)$ and $\deg(g) < \deg(p)$,
        it follows that $\deg(q) > 0$.
    Thus $p$ has been factored into two polynomials with degree 
        greater than $0$, contradicting the irreducibility of $p$.

    Now, suppose $\deg(r) > 0$. We can repeatedly apply the Division Theorem
        to form a sequence of decreasing remainders by their degrees.

    For example, continuing where we left off, we divide $p$ by $r$
        and by the Division Theorem obtain $r_1, q_1 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$
        such that 
    \[p = rq_1 + r_1.\]
    Then $\deg(r_1) < \deg(r) < \deg(g)$.

    If at any point a remainder $r$ is a scalar, it must be the 
        zero polynomial and we contradict the irreducibility of $p$.
    On the other hand, if the sequence never ends, then we contradict the finiteness of
        the degree of $p$.
\end{proof}

    Prove Theorem $5.7$ (Eisenstein's criterion).
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{theorem}[Eisenstein's Criterion]
    Suppose that $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$,
        and 
    \[f = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots +  a_n x^n\]
    Let $p$ be a prime integer, and suppose that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $p$ divides $a_k$, for $0 \le k < n$,
        \item $p$ does not divide $a_n$, and 
        \item $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$
    \end{enumerate}
    Then $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose for contradiction that $f$ is reducible. Then there exist 
    polynomials $g, l \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that 
    $f = g l$:
    \[
    f = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots +  a_n x^n = g l.
    \]
    Now $p$ either divides the constant term of $g$ or $l$;
    otherwise it would not divide the constant term of $f$.  
    Furthermore, if $p$ divides the constant term of both, then   
    $p^2$ would divide the constant term of $f$, which is impossible.  
    Suppose w.l.o.g. that $p$ divides the constant term of $g$ 
    and $p$ does not divide the constant term of $l$.  
    The constant term of $l$ cannot be zero; otherwise the constant term of $f$ would be zero.

    Now consider the first coefficient $b_j$ of $g$ with $j>0$ that is 
    not divisible by $p$. This term exists since coefficientof 
    largest degree term of $g$ is not divisible by $p$.
    Let $c$ be the constant term of $l$, so $p \nmid c$. 
    Then the product $b_j c$ contributes to the coefficient $a_j$ of $f$. 
    Since $p \nmid b_j$ and $p \nmid c$, it follows that $p \nmid b_j c$. 

    Any other contributions to $a_j$ come from products of terms of $g$ and $l$ 
        where at least one factor is divisible by $p$, so those terms are divisible by $p$. 
    Thus the coefficient $a_j$ of $f$ is
    \[
    a_j = b_j c + (\text{terms divisible by } p),
    \]
    which is not divisible by $p$, contradicting the assumption that $p$ divides $a_k$ for all $0 \le k < n$.

Plugging in $x + 1$.
\[p = 2,\quad (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2\]
