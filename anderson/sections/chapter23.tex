\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 1, breakable]
    Find all symmetries of a pyramid as draw below 
    (the base is a square, and the four sides are congruent).
\end{tcolorbox} 

\textbf{Solution:}
There are $4$ symmetries by rotating the base $3$ times plus the identity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 3, breakable]
    Consider the \emph{flatlanders}, who live in the plane 
    and consequently cannot conceive of motion in three dimensions.
    Formulate a definition for $\mathbb{R}^2$ for flatlanders,
    and then determine for them the group of symmetries 
    of the equilateral triangle and the square.
\end{tcolorbox} 

\textbf{Solution:}
A symmetry is a one-to-one onto function $\beta : \mathbb{R}^2 \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$
    which preserves distances and does not reverse the direction of any basis vector.
There are $4$ symmetries of the square and $3$ symmetries of the equilateral triangle 
under this definition of symmetry in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem 8, breakable]
    Consider a cube with a special down face: This face is 
    different, and consequently, a symmetry must leave it alone; the 
    face might be rotated, but must remain the down face.
    (You might imagine a circular dot in the center of this face.)
    How many symmetries of the unmarked cube are still symmetries 
    of this cube.
\end{tcolorbox} 

\textbf{Solution:} The four symmetries that rotate the base.
