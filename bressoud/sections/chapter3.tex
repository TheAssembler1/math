\subsection{Differentiability}

\begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem]
    Given a function $f$ that is differentiable at all 
    points strictly between $a$ and $x$ and continuous
    at all points on the closed interval from $a$ to $x$,
    there exists a real number $c$ strictly between $a$ and $x$ such that 
    \[\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = f'(c).\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Archimedian Understanding of Limits]
    When we write any limit statement such as 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = T.\]
    what we actually mean is that if we take any number $M > T$,
    then we can force $f(x) < M$ by taking $x$ to be sufficiently close 
    to $a$. Similarly, if we take any $L < T$, then we can force $f(x) > L$
    by taking $x$ sufficiently close to (but not equal to) $a$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Derivative of $f$ at $x = a$]
    The \textbf{derivative} of $f$ at $a$ is that value, denoted $f'(a)$,
    such that for any $L < f'(a)$ and any $M > f'(a)$, we can force 
    \[L < \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} < M,\]
    by simply taking $x$ sufficiently close to (but not equal to) $a$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cauchy Definition of Derivative of $f$ at $x = a$]
    The \textbf{derivative} of $f$ at $a$ is that value, denoted $f'(a)$,
    such that for any $\epsilon > 0$, we have a response $\delta > 0$
    so that if $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, then this forces 
    \[
        E(x, a) = \left| f'(a) - \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} \right| < \epsilon.
    \]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Cauchy and the Mean Value Theorem}

\begin{definition}[Intermediate Value Property]
    A function $f$ is said to have the \text{intermediate value property}
    on the interval $[a, b]$ if given any two points $x_1, x_2 \in [a, b]$
    and any number $N$ satisfying
    \[f(x_1) < N < f(x_2),\]
    then there is at least one value $c$ between $x_1$ and $x_2$
    for which $f(c) = N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Generalized Mean Value Theorem]
    If $f$ and $F$ are both continuous at every point of $[a, b]$
    and differentiable at every point on the open interval $(a, b)$
    and $F'$ is never zero in this interval, then 
    \[\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{F(b) - F(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{F'(c)},\]
    for at least one point $c$, $a < c < b$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Continuity}

\begin{definition}[Continuity]
    We say that $f$ is \textbf{continuous at} $a$ if given any positive 
    error bound $\epsilon$, we can always reply with a tolerance $\delta$
    such that if $x$ is within $\delta$ of $a$, then $f(x)$ is within $\epsilon$
    of $f(a)$:
    \[|x - a| = \delta \text{ implies that } |f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon.\]
    To say that $f$ is \textbf{continuous on an interval} $I$ means that it is 
    continuous at every point $a$ in the interval $I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
    If $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ has the 
    intermediate value property on this interval.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Monotonic]
    A function is \textbf{monotonic} on $[a, b]$ if it is \textbf{increasing} on this interval,
    \[a \le x_1 \le x_2 < b \text{ implies that } f(x_1) \le f(x_2),\]
    or if it is \textbf{decreasing} on this interval,
    \[a \le x_1 \le x_2 \le b \text{ implies that } f(x_1) \ge f(x_2).\]
    A function is \textbf{piecewise monotonic} on $[a, b]$ if we can find a partition of this interval 
    into a finite number of subintervals
    \[a = x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_{n - 1} < x_n = b,\]
    for which the function is monotonic on each open subinterval $(x_i, x_{i + 1})$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Modified Converse to IVT]
    If $f$ is a piecewise monotonic and satisfies the intermediate value property on the 
    interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ is continuous at every point $c$ in $(a, b)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Differentiable implies Continuous]
    If $f$ is differentiable at $x = c$, then $f$ is continuous at $x = c$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[One-side Limits and Derivatives]
    The \textbf{limit from the right,} $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x),$ is the target value $T$,
        with the property that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is a reponse $\delta$ so that if 
        $a < x < a + \delta$, then $|f(x) - T| < \epsilon$. The \textbf{one-sided derivatives}
        are defined by 
    \[f'_+(a) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}, \quad f'_{-}(a) = \lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}.\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Consequences of Continuity}

\begin{theorem}[Continuous implies Bounded]
    If $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$,
    then there exists finite $A$ and $B$ such that 
    \[A \le f(x) \le B,\]
    for all $x \in [a, b]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Least Upper, Greatest Lower Bounds]
    Given a set $S$, the \textbf{least upper bound} or \textbf{supremum} of $S$,
        denoted sup $S$, is the number $G$ with the property that for any numbers 
        $L < G$ and $M > G$, there is at least one elemement of $S$ that is strictly 
        larger than $L$ and at least one upper bound for $S$ that is strictly smaller than $M$.
    The \textbf{greatest lower bound} or \textbf{infimum} of $S$, denoted inf $S$,
        is the negative of the least upper bound of $-S = \{-s \mid s \in S\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Upperbound implies Least Upper Bound] 
    In the real numbers, every set 
    that has an upper bound also has a least upper bound and every 
    set that has a lower bound also has a greatest lower bound.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Continuous implies Bounds Achieved]
    If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then 
    it achieves its greatest lower bound and its least upper bound.
    Equivalently, there exists $k_1, k_2 \in [a, b]$ such that 
    \[f(k_1) \le f(x) \le f(k_2),\]
    for all $x \in [a, b]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Fermat's Theorem on Extrema]
    If $f$ has an extremum at a point $c \in (a, b) [f(c) \ge f(x)$
        for all $x \in (a, b)$ or $f(c) \le f(x)$ for all $x \in (a, b)$]
        and if $f$ is differentiable at every point in $(a, b)$, then $f'(c) = 0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Rolle's Theorem]
    Let $f$ be a function that is continuous on $[a, b]$
    and differentiable on $(a, b)$ and for which $f(a) = f(b) = 0$.
    There exists at least one $c$, $a < c < b$, for $f'(c) = 0$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Consequences of the Mean Value Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Remainder Theorem]
    Given a function $f$ for which all derivatives exist at $x = a$,
    let $D_n(a, x)$ denote the difference between the $n$th partial 
    sum of the Taylor series for $f$ expanded about $x = a$ and the 
    target value $f(x)$,
    \[D_n(a, x) = f(x) - \left(f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n - 1)}(a)}{(n - 1)!}(x - a)^{n - 1}\right).\]
    There is at least one real number $c$ strictly between $a$ and $x$ for which 
    \[D_n(a, x) = \frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{(n - 1)!}(x - c)^{n - 1}(x - a).\]
\end{theorem}


\begin{definition}[Infinite Limit and Limit at Infinity]
    The statement 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty,\]
    means that for any real number $L$, we can force $f(x) > L$
    by restricting $x$ to be sufficiently close to $a$.
    That is to say, there is a $\delta > 0$ so that $|x - a| < \delta$ implies 
    $f(x) > L$. When we write 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}f(x) = T,\]
    we mean that for any positive $\epsilon$, we can force 
    $f(x)$ to be within $\epsilon$ of $T$ by taking $x$
    sufficiently large. In other words, there is an $N$
    so that $x > N$ implies that $|f(x) - T| < \epsilon$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[L'Hoposital's Rule: 0/0]
    If $f$ and $F$ are both differentiable inside an open interval that contains $a$, if 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = 0 = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} F(x),\]
    if $F'(x) \ne 0$ for all $x$ in this open interval, and if $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f'(x) / F'(x)$ exists, then 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{F(x)} = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f'(x)}{F'(x)}.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[L'Hopsital's Rule: $\infty/\infty$]
    If $f$ and $F$ are both differentiable at every point except $x = a$
    in an open interval that contains $a$, if 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} |F(x)| = \infty,\]
    if $F'(x) \ne 0$ for all $x$ in this open interval, and if $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f'(x) / F'(x)$
    exists, then 
    \[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{F(x)} = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f'(x)}{F'(x)}.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Darboux's Theorem]
    If $f$ is differentiable on $[a, b]$, then $f'$ has the intermediate value property on $[a, b]$.
\end{theorem}
