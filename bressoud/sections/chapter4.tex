\subsection{The Basic Tests of Convergence}

\begin{definition}
    An infinite series \textbf{converges} if there is a value $T$
    with the property that for each $\epsilon > 0$ there is a response $N$ 
    so that all of the partial sums with at least $N$ terms lie strictly 
    within the open interval $(T - \epsilon, T + \epsilon)$.
\end{definition}
